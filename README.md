# xlns-project

My Code Challenge Submission for my GSoC Proposal for the University of Alaska Anchorage
[2] Support for Logarithmic Number Systems in a Deep-Learning Framework for GSoC (Code Challenge)

Challenge 1: Demonstrated the inability to convert directly from xln (Logarithmic Number System) format to PyTorch tensor or Tensorflow tensor and perform basic calculations.
Note: This can still be achieved in NumPy

Challenge 2: Plan to implement a multilayer perceptron in PyTorch with the flow:
28*28 input -> 100 hidden nodes -> ReLU -> 10 output nodes -> softmax and compare performance with arn_generic.py

Challenge 3: Use PyTorch tensors to create a toy-example that performs the same way as the overloaded addition operation does for xlnsnp arrays.
